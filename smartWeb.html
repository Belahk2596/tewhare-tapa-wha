    <p class="p-first">Hi my name is Khaleb, a vibrant 28-year-old who balances a busy life with a passion for fitness and fun. When not hitting the gym or spending quality time with my son, I enjoy unwinding with some anime on the weekends and savoring a few beers on a Saturday night. Recently, I have dived into the world of coding, exploring new horizons and expanding my skills. With a dream car of owning a BMW M8, I'm driven by both personal goals and the excitement of new challenges.</p>

    <h1>Te Whare Tapa Whā</h1>
    <h3>Hinengaro</h3>
    <p>"Hinengaro" is a Māori term from New Zealand that translates to "mind" or "mental state" in English. It encompasses aspects of mental health, thought processes, and psychological well-being. In Māori culture, hinengaro is integral to understanding one's emotional and mental health, reflecting how the mind interacts with one's overall well-being. It’s part of a broader holistic view that includes physical, spiritual, and emotional dimensions.</p>
    <h3>Wairua</h3>
    <p>"Wairua" is a Māori term that translates to "spirit" or "soul" in English. It refers to the spiritual essence or the non-physical aspect of a person, encompassing their inner being and connection to the divine or the universe. In Māori culture, wairua is considered a vital part of an individual's overall well-being, intertwined with their physical and mental health. It reflects a deep connection to the spiritual world and the ancestral lineage, playing a crucial role in one’s sense of identity and purpose.</p>
    <h3>Tinana</h3>
    <p>In Māori, "Tinana" refers to the physical body or physical self. It encompasses the tangible, material aspect of a person, including their physical health and well-being. In the context of Māori culture, tinana is one of the three key components of overall well-being, along with hinengaro (mind) and wairua (spirit). Maintaining a balance among these aspects—tinana, hinengaro, and wairua—is essential for holistic health and harmony.</p>
    <h3>Whānau</h3>
    <p>"Whānau" is a Māori term that translates to "family" in English. However, its meaning extends beyond the nuclear family to include extended family and close community networks. Whānau encompasses not just biological relatives but also people who are considered family through shared relationships, cultural ties, and mutual support.</p>
    <h3>Whenua</h3>
    <p>"Whenua" is a Māori term that translates to "land" or "earth" in English. It holds deep cultural and spiritual significance in Māori society. Whenua represents not only the physical land but also a connection to ancestry, identity, and heritage. It is often seen as a living entity that nourishes and sustains people, reflecting a profound relationship between the land and its inhabitants. </p>
